Dynamic Package Manager (DPM)

  dpm is a package management tool for Arch Linux, wrapping GNU stow, pacman and yay.

  it's functionality is split into many small "dpm-" binaries

OVERVIEW

  all packages are installed to "/stow" rather than "/"

  they can be dynamically enabled/disabled by stowing/unstowing them to "/"

MANIFEST FILES

  you can stow/unstow/install/uninstall apps from manifest files

  these are markdown files, where lines starting with #
  are treated as a comment, and every other line is
  treated as the name of a package

  this allows you to group apps under markdown headings
  the process will strip out the headings for you when
  manipulating the manifest file

  example packages.md file:

    # my packages

    ## media
    sxiv
    vlc

    ## web
    firefox
    qutebrowser

  will be compiled to:

    firefox
    qutebrowser
    sxiv
    vlc
